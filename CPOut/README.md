This is the output of CellProfiler analysis (from step 1)

The script **MachineLeaning**/*MLCP.ipynb* or **MachineLeaning**/*MLCP.py* in its current stage will need to be placed in a folder at the same level with folder “CPOut”, which contains CellProfiler output.

These scripts will also look for files named “DefaultDB_train.db” and “DefaultDB_test.db” , which are SQLite databases, inside “CPOut”. Please consider this if you need to change the name and type of CellProfiler output.

If you wish, you can change these path and names easily by editing the script itself using any text editor.
