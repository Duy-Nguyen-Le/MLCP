The images collected from IFC contain signals from bright field, dark field and DNA stain. We aimed to use only bright field and dark field signals (which are label-free) to predict the phase of the cell cycle.

The images from IFC were exported as a single cellular object per .TIF . Here they were stitched together to form 30x30 montages. Please visit here for the stitching script : https://github.com/CellProfiler/stitching
