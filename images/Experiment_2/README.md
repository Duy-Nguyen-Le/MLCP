In this experiment, all the cells are at G1. If the trained model is efficiently trained, the prediction should predict 100% of the cells as G1.

You can also "trick" the test by intentionally rename the folder to any other phases, e.g. "G2" or "Anaphase" etc. The test result should then give 100% wrong prediction, as demonstrated in this vignette.
